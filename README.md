# DoCPNotes - Notes from Peter Norvig's Design of Computer Programs
I've worked through Peter Norvig's [Design of Computer Programs](https://www.udacity.com/course/design-of-computer-programs--cs212) Udacity class several ties. It's the programming equivalent of a master class, a chance for a regular programmer to see how a master programmer thinks about software.

I'm putting some notes here to capture some of the utilities and concepts for future reference.
